# PARASOLID .X_T FILE CONVERSION INSTRUCTIONS

## What Are These Files?
- **assignment1.x_t** and **assignment2.x_t** are Parasolid 3D CAD files
- Created in **SolidWorks 2019** on **August 7, 2025**
- File sizes: ~2.4MB (Assignment1), ~2.1MB (Assignment2)
- Content: Complex 3D geometry with precision surfaces

## CONVERSION METHOD 1: Online Converters (Recommended)

### Option A: eMachineShop (Free, No Signup)
1. Go to: https://convert.emachineshop.com/
2. Upload your .x_t file
3. Select output format: **STEP (.step)** 
4. Download converted file
5. Import STEP file into FreeCAD

### Option B: ConvertCADFiles.com (Free Trial)
1. Go to: https://convertcadfiles.com/
2. Upload .x_t file (max 50KB for free)
3. Convert to STEP format
4. For larger files, pay €1 per conversion

### Option C: CAD Exchanger (Professional)
1. Go to: https://cadexchanger.com/
2. Upload .x_t file
3. Convert to STEP, STL, or other formats
4. Download result

## CONVERSION METHOD 2: Professional Software

### SolidWorks (If Available)
1. Open .x_t file in SolidWorks
2. File → Save As
3. Choose format: **STEP Files (*.step)**
4. Save and use in other CAD software

### Fusion 360 (Free for Personal Use)
1. Download Fusion 360 from Autodesk
2. File → Open → Select .x_t file
3. File → Export → Choose STEP format
4. Use converted file

### FreeCAD (May Work with Newer Versions)
1. Download latest FreeCAD (0.21+)
2. File → Import
3. Select .x_t file
4. If successful, export as STEP

## CONVERSION METHOD 3: Alternative Approaches

### Using 3D Viewer Software
1. Download **3D-Tool Free Viewer**
2. Open .x_t file for viewing
3. Export as STL or other format
4. Import STL into FreeCAD (as mesh)

### Using Online Services
1. **GrabCAD Workbench** - Can sometimes view Parasolid
2. **Onshape** - Import and re-export capability
3. **Tinkercad** - Limited support but worth trying

## WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER CONVERSION

### If Successful:
- 3D geometry will be preserved
- Can integrate with our Method 1 design
- Parametric features may be lost
- Surface quality should remain good

### File Contents Likely Include:
- **Assignment 1:** Torque test fixture/jig
- **Assignment 2:** Pendulum/rope system components
- Complex curved surfaces and precision features
- Assembly components with proper tolerances

## INTEGRATION WITH OUR METHOD 1 DESIGN

Once converted to STEP format:
1. Import into FreeCAD alongside our Method 1 design
2. Compare dimensions and interfaces
3. Adapt our professional design if needed
4. Create hybrid design combining best features

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Conversion Fails:
1. Try different online converters
2. Contact original file creator for STEP export
3. Use our professional Method 1 design as baseline
4. Manually recreate critical dimensions

### File Size Issues:
- Original files are large (2+ MB each)
- May need professional converter for full fidelity
- Consider mesh conversion (STL) if solid model fails

## COST ESTIMATE

- **Free options:** eMachineShop, 3D-Tool viewer
- **Low cost:** €1-5 per file via online converters  
- **Professional:** $50-200 for CAD conversion software
- **Alternative:** Use our Method 1 professional design

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Try eMachineShop converter first** (free, reliable)
2. **Compare with our Method 1 design** for integration
3. **Document any design differences** found
4. **Update our CAD models** if needed based on original designs
