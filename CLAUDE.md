# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Motor Test Sandbox project - a minimal repository currently containing only a basic README.md file. The project appears to be in its initial stages with no code, dependencies, or build system configured yet.

## Current State

- Repository contains only a README.md with the title "Motor Test Sandbox"
- No package.json, dependencies, or build configuration present
- No source code files (.js, .ts, .py, etc.) currently exist
- Clean git repository with initial commit

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without established tooling, development commands will need to be configured as the project grows. Future instances should check for:

- Package manager configuration (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build and test scripts
- Language-specific tooling and linting rules

## Architecture

No architectural patterns have been established yet. The project structure and technology stack are yet to be determined.
