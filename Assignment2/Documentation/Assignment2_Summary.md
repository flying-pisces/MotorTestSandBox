## Technical Analysis

### Force Transmission Analysis

The rope transmission system acts as a mechanical advantage system where:
1. Each rope segment force is amplified by the diameter ratio of connected shafts
2. Torque is amplified by the same ratio, providing mechanical advantage
3. The total system provides 3.25:1 rope reduction plus 10:1 gearbox = 32.5:1 total

### Load Characteristics

**Maximum Load Conditions:**
- Occurs at horizontal position (0°) where full gravitational moment acts
- Minimum torque at vertical position (90°) where moment arm is zero
- Variable load requires motor to handle dynamic torque requirements

### Control System Design

**Motion Profile Strategy:**
- Trapezoidal velocity profile ensures smooth acceleration/deceleration
- Prevents excessive stress on rope system during direction changes
- Configurable parameters allow optimization for different test requirements

## Validation and Testing

### Calculation Verification
- ✅ Independent verification using total reduction ratio method
- ✅ Energy balance confirmation across all transmission stages
- ✅ Units analysis and dimensional consistency check

### Software Validation
- ✅ Motion profile generation with proper acceleration limits
- ✅ Safety interlock implementation with hardware backup
- ✅ Real-time data logging for test validation

### Hardware Design Review
